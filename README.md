# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This is an overall description and analysis on how the particular data helps in supermarket study.
As a Business Manager, this would be helpful in finding out the weak areas where there is loss percentage in retail supplies.
We start by importing various libraries like numpy,pandas, matplotlib, seaborn etc.
We then get the data in the form of a table which contains all sorts of data. Please note this is just based in United States, not anywhere else.
As there are about 10000 entries across the country, the number of categories were limited to just 3; Furnitures, Office Supplies and Technology.
We understand the datatypes of variables and find number of count of each category and sub-category. This list varies from Machines, Phones, Binders etc.
We plot a grpah which shows which things a customer should consider when he/she should buy a product.
A pie chart has been displayed with the various sub categories how they are performing and the sales variation.
We now group by the Sales and Profit and calculate the Profit percentage which is very critical for a particular retail business
Based on a countplot, we come to know how the region supplied varied and subsequently the overall profit percentage for all the stores were calculated and on it's basis we have come to a conclusion how the retail shops performed.
